# Credit-Fraud-Analysis
The goal of this project is to explore a dataset containing information about credit card transactions and address the challenge of imbalanced data. The dataset contains information about both fraudulent and authentic transactions, but the number of fraudulent transactions is significantly lower than the number of authentic transactions.
